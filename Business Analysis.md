  - Find resources that allow for entire data to be shown so that the client could see the developments done to the business because of having a website.
- Long Term System Plan
  - An important focus is to keep requirements clear and specfic and set specific time constraints on when those plans should be done. That way theres time to set plans on how to get the requirement done. Regular updates and tests done to webstie to check if its up to dates and that there are no errors. 
- Database Configuration
  - For now learn about SQL and learn how to create databases and store information. This will become useful when it comes to learning how to store the information of the customers buying products. 
# 4. Business operational requirement
##  1. Business Processes 
The business would first think of ideas of what to do for products, or even in a future sense use ideas given by customers, and then create their products. Then the client would have his products photographed and moved onto website. Client would be able to give their products captions and state their reasoning for creating product. Then users would be able to buy the now displayed products. 
##  2. Business opertaional policies and rules
For anyone who is in charge of the social media accounts for the business, it is imporant for them to maintain a respectable image on those platforms, as well as lending a guiding hand to anyone who's interested in learning about the business. This would be similar to other businesses which is also known as the Employee Conduct Policy. Since its an online business, the Shipping Policy, Return and Exchange Policy, and Privacy Policy shall also be implemented. Lastly, the Terms of Service shall be displayed on the website.
##  3. Business operational constraints
The website should be checked bi-weekly to check if there are any errors/bugs. The website should allow for products to be uploaded or removed at any time. Products stock should be updated daily. Product Inventory also updated daily. 
##  4. Business operational modes
During the holidays, products get bought more often and are expected to be delivered by certain dates, therfore website should siplay message when these dates come up, letting their customers know if invenotry is low or if delivery dates take longer than expected. 
##  5. Business operational quality
Considering the business is located in SWFL, if there were to be a hurricane, website would send out notification letting customers know that customers whose orders were before news of the hurricane would have priority over the ones that were not. Customers with accounts would be prioritized over guest accounts and purchases.
##  6. Business strcuture 
Since this is a new business, the client's role would be to creator of the products, photographer, and in charge of completing orders. As the developer, I would be in charge of maintaining the website, keeping up with the database, and uploading product pictures. As the business grows, things would change.
