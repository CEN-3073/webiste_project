  - Find resources that allow for entire data to be shown so that the client could see the developments done to the business because of having a website.
- Long Term System Plan
  - An important focus is to keep requirements clear and specfic and set specific time constraints on when those plans should be done. That way theres time to set plans on how to get the requirement done. Regular updates and tests done to webstie to check if its up to dates and that there are no errors. 
- Database Configuration
  - For now learn about SQL and learn how to create databases and store information. This will become useful when it comes to learning how to store the information of the customers buying products. 
# 4. Business operational requirement
##  1. Business Processes 
The business would first think of ideas of what to do for products, or even in a future sense use ideas given by customers, and then create their products. Then the client would have his products photographed and moved onto website. Client would be able to give their products captions and state their reasoning for creating product. Then users would be able to buy the now displayed products. 
##  2. Business opertaional policies and rules
For anyone who is in charge of the social media accounts for the business, it is imporant for them to maintain a respectable image on those platforms, as well as lending a guiding hand to anyone who's interested in learning about the business. This would be similar to other businesses which is also known as the Employee Conduct Policy. Since its an online business, the Shipping Policy, Return and Exchange Policy, and Privacy Policy shall also be implemented. Lastly, the Terms of Service shall be displayed on the website.
##  3. Business operational constraints
The website should be checked bi-weekly to check if there are any errors/bugs. The website should allow for products to be uploaded or removed at any time. Products stock should be updated daily. Product Inventory also updated daily. 
##  4. Business operational modes
During the holidays, products get bought more often and are expected to be delivered by certain dates, therfore website should siplay message when these dates come up, letting their customers know if invenotry is low or if delivery dates take longer than expected. 
##  5. Business operational quality
Considering the business is located in SWFL, if there were to be a hurricane, website would send out notification letting customers know that customers whose orders were before news of the hurricane would have priority over the ones that were not. Customers with accounts would be prioritized over guest accounts and purchases.
##  6. Business strcuture 
Since this is a new business, the client's role would be to creator of the products, photographer, and in charge of completing orders. As the developer, I would be in charge of maintaining the website, keeping up with the database, and uploading product pictures. As the business grows, things would change.

The admin role will be able to see things such as how active the website is, they will be able to access the database to see the information entered by users, and be able to add products to the website. 
###      e) support environment

##  5.2 Preliminary operational scenarios
Users will be able to go onto the webiste and be able to navigate to diffrent pages such as the home page, product page, and about us page. The user will be able to see the different products that are being sold, learn more about them, and then choose if they want to go back to previous page or add it to the cart. If the user has items in their cart, they will be able to start the process to buy the products.

Maintenance will check that the website is running smoothly and that there are no bugs with links or on the overall display of pages.

# 6. Other preliminary life-cycle concepts

##  6.1 Preliminary acquisition concept
The system solution will be aquired through the completion of the project. The project will meet the business purpose, in which the owner wants to be able to sell their products to custosmers in order to create bonds within families. The business will be able to display the current products being sold by CollectionCraft, The business will allow for users to add buy products and enter their information, which that inforrmation will be saved into the database. Allowing for the owner to send to orders to its users. 
##  6.2 Preliminary deployment concept
Once the website is ready to be deployed and requirements where met, it will go be shared with people close to the business owner so that they can test the website and report if there are any bugs or if something is off. Then the website will be given the green light, which means they will look for a company to host the wesbite so that it constantly stays online. Lastly the website will be advertised on different social media platforms to gather an audience.
##  6.3 Preliminary support concept
Once the webiste is deployed there should be a team made, whose main job is keeping the webiste up to date and performing maintenance. They will be in charge of keeping up with the OS, making sure there are no problems. This team will be made under the company and will be employess for them. As the business gets biggger there will be a need for certain parts of the business to grow for example, production will have to grow into a team instead of a one man person, because they would need to keep up with the orders. Other things like the need for supplies and shipping will have their own teams built around them. 
##  6.4 Preliminary retirement concept
Once the business decides that they have completed their vision and have decided to retire, they will send out an email to all previous cusotmers letting them know about the ending of the business. There will be final sellinng of products then the company hosting the website wil be notified that this website will no longer be up and running and social media platforms will be deleted. 
# 7. Project Constraints
There will be many project constraints. First since the business is new and doesn't have an audience, they will be working with a small budget so a lot of things will be coming out of pocket instead of the business paying for itself. So there will be money constraints, but once the buisness grows an audience it will lessen. Time constraints shouldn't be a problem unless there is a weather emergency since the business is located in SWFL, production could slow down.
